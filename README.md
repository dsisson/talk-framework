# How to build a simple, lightweight, custom test automation framework for functional and end-to-end testing.

This is the title of a talk I gave at the Bay Area Python Interest Group (BAyPIGgies) on July 27, 2018 on the Linkedin campus in Sunnyale, California. Thank you for being an awesome audience, Baypiggies, I had a great time!

You can find the original slides here, as well as an updated version (updated based on the questions I received after the talk).


## The Context Around Test Framework Design

This talk describes the rationale behind building a custom test automation framework, and presents a simple project structure that I've found to be useful and workable. The point of view is that of a test or quality assurance team testing applications, rather than developers writing unit test for their own code.

The big picture context for this talk looks something like this:
* A discussion of where tests come from, covering approaches to identifying things that should be tested, and how. You need a methodology for identifying and defining tests so that you have a queue of tests that could and should be automated.
* How to design and build a custom test automation framework -- this talk ;)
* A discussion of test case architecture, both manual and automated. Writing a test cases that does what you _think_ it does is a fundamental skill. Plus, parametrization!
